Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with a method called getArea().
 Create a subclass called Rectangle that overrides the getArea() method 
 to calculate the area of a rectangle.
Q.2)Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called deposit() 
and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the withdraw() method 
to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one hundred.
Q.3)Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with methods called getPerimeter() and getArea().
